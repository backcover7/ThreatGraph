  threat:
    - id: 12bf302e-e30b-4b18-b732-69fffea9c4d7
      name: HTTP Proxy Content Manipulation
      severity: high
      description: An attacker could manipulate the content of HTTP responses passing through the forward proxy, potentially injecting malicious code or altering sensitive information.
      mitigation: Implement HTTPS everywhere, use robust encryption, and employ certificate pinning to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. Regularly audit proxy logs for suspicious activities.

      name: Proxy-based IP Spoofing
      severity: medium
      description: Attackers could use the forward proxy to mask their true IP address, potentially bypassing IP-based access controls or hiding malicious activities.
      mitigation: Implement strong authentication mechanisms for proxy usage, monitor proxy logs for unusual patterns, and use additional identity verification methods beyond IP-based controls.
