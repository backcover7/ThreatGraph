  name: Improper Access Control
  severity: high
  description: Improper access control occurs when an application fails to properly restrict access to resources or functionalities based on user privileges. This vulnerability allows unauthorized users to view, modify, or perform actions they should not have permission for. It can lead to data breaches, unauthorized data manipulation, and compromise of system integrity.
  mitigation: Implement robust authentication mechanisms. Use role-based access control (RBAC). Apply the principle of least privilege. Consistently enforce access controls on all pages and API endpoints. Use secure session management. Implement proper authorization checks for all sensitive operations. Regularly audit and test access control mechanisms. Use security frameworks that provide built-in access control features.

  name: Least Privilege Violation
  severity: medium
  description: The system grants more privileges to users than necessary for their roles.
  mitigation: Implement the principle of least privilege by granting only the minimum required permissions to users.
